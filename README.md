My Meteor Boilerplate
=========================

I was getting tired of creating the same folder structure over and over again.

I couldn't get [Meteor boilerplate](https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-boilerplate) to work with Meteor 0.9 so I made this.

These packages are included:

- standard-app-packages
- spiderable
- iron:router
- mrt:momentjs
- sacha:spin
- accounts-password
- accounts-facebook
- accounts-ui
- underscore
- meteor-collection-hooks

Inside the public folder there's a Codekit Compass project set up.
